# Troubleshooting

## General

Here are some general tips for when things go wrong.

### Read integrity

Your reads might be badly formatted or the number of reads might be too low.
You can optionally download [Fasten](https://github.com/lskatz/fasten) and install it separately.
Then, run `fasten_validate --help` or `fasten_inspect --help`
and follow instructions on how to check each read set.
